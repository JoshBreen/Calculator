# Calculator

Attempting to make a GUI based Calculator. I have the basic functions of it working. I still need to implement the decimal button and
fix the label to show 0 when the calculator is cleared. Future update plan is to implement error controls for math errors like dividing by 0, and I plan to add a button for switching to negative numbers.
